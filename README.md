# Networking Test

This was supposed to be a simple thing to play around with Sockets. Turns out, doing so it's a bad idea

Don't expect this to be finished at the brink of time... I think I will not do so, this is supposed to be, after all, a test library.

## Features (as of now, and very suspiciously not tested)

- Sending Messages to a remote party with ease, with the possibility of using Base64 encoding
- A simple Wrapper for the Socket class, still work in progress
